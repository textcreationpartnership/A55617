            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FOR Satisfaction to thoſe, to whom Cuſtom makes a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face a Debt, the Author is willing to let us know, that this Treatiſe of Patience was the Argument of ſeveral Letters written to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Honour and Religion to ſupport her under one of the heavieſt Strokes that God's hand could lay upon her in this World, except he had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Spirit with ſo deep a Sence of his Diſpleaſure againſt her, by reaſon of her Sins, as not to be aſſwaged, and made his Arrows ſtick ſo faſt there, as not to be drawn out.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:35429:3"/>
            <p>And tho' what ſhe then found in ſome meaſure uſeful to the mitigating her Anguiſh under ſo ſharp a Trial and the ſtaying her Mind from ſinking under ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a Blow, ſhe judged might be beneficial to others in ſome circumſtances of Sorrow like hers, or any other ſort of Trouble the World is full of, either to calm and ſoften the Violence of their Paſſions, or to uphold their Minds from extreme Dejection, or raiſe them up again; and thereupon deſired it might be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their benefit as far as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it would ſerve that end; yet the Author at that time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly declined the complying with that Requeſt, upon this Conſideration among others, that though ſhe was a Perſon in her ſelf of a very accurate Judgment, yet ſhe might paſs too favourable,
<pb facs="tcp:35429:3"/> and conſequently a partial one on it with regard to him who ſent it; and that ſhe probably might commend the Preſcriptions contained in it; not becauſe they had any extraordinary Virtue in them to give her any eaſe, or to help towards working a Cure upon her afflicted Spirit, but from being pleaſed with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Intentions of him who dictated them to her in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; as ſome Medicines prove many times effectual to the relief of a Patient, not ſo much from having a Force adequate to the Diſtemper, as from the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons good Opinion of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who directed them. Since that time till almoſt this preſent, this Tract hath been laid aſide neglected among ſeveral other Papers, both of different, and agreeable Subjects to it: When
<pb facs="tcp:35429:4"/> the Author reſumed and review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, to try what aſſiſtance he could draw from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations therein offered to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to buoy up his own Mind under a leſs ſort of Calamity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him (as that Word is often applied to ſignifie the diminution of ones Condition) and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to bear the Adverſity, as in the Phraſe of the World any ſort of Suffering is ſtyled.</p>
            <p>And finding ſome Advantage of that kind to himſelf from peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his own Meditations, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thence to entertain an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (and hopes it may not be too kind and fond a one) That perhaps they might be in the ſame ſort beneficial to others. And indeed the Shipwracks which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Mankind on this Sea, which is the Scene of their Commerce and Management of Affairs, are
<pb facs="tcp:35429:4"/> ſo frequent, as render innumerable Perſons ſo miſerable, at leaſt as to ſtand in need of being relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by good Counſel; the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſo many, various and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by which they are thrown down from their Station, when they have imagined themſelves moſt ſtrongly rooted, and by the Fall ſo bruiſed and cruſhed, that make it a ſeaſonable Charity to endeavour to bind up their Wounds, to pour in ſome Oyl to mollifie their eagerneſs, and to adminiſter ſome Wine to revive and refreſh their Spirits. And laſt of all, there are multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe Virtue being too ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, weak and drooping to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and maintain it ſelf againſt any violent ſhock, may make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have it excited, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and animated by ſuch Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory Diſcourſes, and confirmed
<pb facs="tcp:35429:5"/> by the Heroick Behaviour of thoſe, whoſe Examples are here repreſented.</p>
            <p>If God ſhall be pleaſed by the influence of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to proſper the Advices here laid down, the Reaſons, with Motives and Encouragements, by which they are enforced, ſo as they may work any part of the fore-mentioned good effects on any perſon who ſhall have the mind or opportunity to peruſe them, he who makes them Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick will have the abundant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of having attained the end he propounded in doing ſo, and the pleaſure of having thoſe good Wiſhes he ſends them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with into the World anſwered and compleated, and may God have all the Glory.</p>

            <head>A Practical Diſcourſe OF PATIENCE.</head>
            <p>SINCE there is nothing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<note place="margin">The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the Argument uſeful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Viciſſitudes of the worldly Calamities of Humane Life.</note> and durable in this World, no, not it ſelf; but the Earth, while it is laid upon Foundations ſo ſure that it cannot be moved, ſhall yet melt away like Wax at the Second and Glorious Appearance of our Lord, when he ſhall return to judge the World: The Heavens likewiſe, and thoſe Faithful Witneſſes the Sun and Moon, ſhall not keep their Courſes for ever, [nor have ſome Planets, if <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Obſervation be true, kept the ſame Figure, Greatneſs and Motion they had] but ſhall at that day paſs away
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35429:9"/> like thin Miſts before the Meridian Heat.</p>
            <p>Since many of the leſs parts of the Earth moulder and decay before-hand, goodly Territories have been ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by Inundations or Earthquakes, and the faireſt Cities have by the hand of Time been laid as low in the ground as the Quarries whence their Stones were firſt dug: Stately and magnificent Piles of Building have been buried ſo deep under their own Ruines, as the moſt Curious with all their Inquiſition, have not been able to diſcover the place of their Interment.</p>
            <p>Since the mightieſt and ſtrongeſt built Empires have had their Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Wane and Period as well as their Birth, Riſe and Growth; and thoſe which now are, ſhall have the ſame Fate.</p>
            <p>Since every day ſhews the brittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and variableneſs of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſcarce a larger portion of Time paſſeth over our Heads, which makes not a conſiderable Change in our Condition; and not the ſmalleſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this kind, either befalling befalling our ſelves, or things, or perſons, for which we have an Affection, if we are Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers

I cannot think but it may be uſeful to Mankind in general, and in part ſeaſonable to ſeveral afflicted Members of that great Community, to recommend to them the exerciſe of this Vertue of Patience for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>§ 2. This will be beſt done, if in a<note place="margin">The Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note> Diſcourſe on this Argument I begin with declaring the Nature of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and inſtructing them what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is. (2.) Then proceed to the producing ſuch Arguments which may convince them, that the practice of it, even upon ſuch occaſions, which are ſo ſharp, as they may ſeem at moſt to juſtifie, or at leaſt to excuſe inordinate Paſſion, is moſt reaſonable. (3.) Next to the propounding ſuch Examples as may induce them by the Imitation of them to the Exerciſe of it, (4.) And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35429:10"/> conclude in preſcribing ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the eaſier attaining to, or the better diſcharge of it.</p>
            <p>But before I ſet my hands to work upon the Materials I have marked out, or by the Model I have drawn, it's but juſt to premiſe an humble Confeſſion to my own Reproach, of my unfitneſs to Treat of this Subject, imitating herein that Father, who arreſted himſelf at the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul. c. 1. de Pat. p. 159. ad Rig. confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor ad Dominum Deum, ſatis temerè me,</hi> &amp;c.</note> very entrance of his Diſcourſe upon this Theme to do ſo.</p>
            <p>As he therefore, ſo I likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I may appear too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent in the Eyes of the All-ſeeing God, and too preſumptuous in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my Fellow-Creatures, who know me to adventure upon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Vertue of Patience to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who find it too hard a Task for my own Weakneſs to practice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is highly convenient, if not in ſome meaſure neceſſary, that they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Recommendation of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to others, ſhould firſt be Maſters of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>For it's a ſhame that any ones Words and Actions; a greater, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of an Inſtructor, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhould be at variance with

            <p>§ 3. This being premiſed, I enter<note place="margin">The Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Patience.</note> upon declaring what this Patience is, which ſhould Sovereignly preſide o're, and manage the Motions of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Soul, eſpecially thoſe of the Iraſcible Faculty.</p>

            <p>From whence we may collect, that we then poſſeſs our Souls in Patience, which is what we are commanded by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35429:11"/> our Saviour to do <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 21. 19.</note>, or that <hi>Patience hath then it's perfect work,</hi> which is what the Apoſtle exhorts us to let it have <note n="†" place="margin">Ja. 1. 3.</note>; when the ſeveral Viciſſitudes and Changes without, cauſe no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within, when we continue the ſame through all the various Scenes we paſs, or amidſt all the Revolutions which turn over our Heads.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35429:11"/> of it's being foundred at Sea or taken; the Devaſtation of our Houſes and Goods, or their Preſervation; the Conſumption of our Herds and Flocks by a Murrein, or any other Caſualty, or their proſperous increaſe; Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Impriſonment of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the enjoyment of our Country and Liberty; the Sentence of Death or the Grant of Life.</p>
            <p>This in many Particulars, was that equal Behaviour for which <hi>Job</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, and in which he is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us for an Example. And ſuch a Carriage is the fulleſt Evidence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable of our poſſeſſing our Souls in the moſt perfect meaſure of Patience; to which, whether we can attain or not, we ought to aſpire and contend for it. And ſomething like this was that frame of Mind which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers would have us believe the froward <hi>Xantippe</hi> could not chooſe but admire and extol in her Husband <hi>Socrates,</hi> while ſhe beheld in him the ſame unalter'd Viſage at his returning home as at his going abroad; which might very well be, if as the Orator<note place="margin">Cice. Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul. 3.</note> repreſents it, There was no change in his Mind to make any in the Air of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35429:12"/> his Countenance: But that which kept his Mind even and unvariable, was his Patience which had the guard of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Deſcriptions may poſſibly be of too large a Circuit to be adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appropriated to this ſingle Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Patience only, ſince they ſeem likewiſe to involve and comprehend the Notions of Moderation, Conſtancy and Firmneſs of Mind. If therefore we would accurately diſtinguiſh and ſeparate this Vertue of Patience from theſe which have ſuch a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and near relation with it, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and bound it within it's juſt terms, we may define it, foraſmuch as it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object is Adverſity, to be a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affliction without Preturbation; or a bearing the Evils which may be intentionally done us, or without the deſigned Malice of our Enemies may in the courſe of our Lives befall us, with an evenneſs of Mind.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Arguments to ſhow the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or repreſent the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. The Arguments which may ſerve to evince that we ought to have our Souls thus armed and fortify'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtrokes of Adverſity; or that upon ſuch an occaſion we ought to ſupport our ſelves with the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this Vertue, are many; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35429:12"/> the firſt that I ſhall produce ſhall be framed by way of Remonſtrance of the Inconveniences and Miſchiefs proceeding from the contrary Vice of Impatience, ſuch as will ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this to our Practice: As an ill Face repreſented together with a good one, ſets off the Beauties and Graces of this to Advantage.</p>
            <p>This was the Original Sin of <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all our ills, lets us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> that bright Son of the Morning, and of thoſe Troops of Angels that aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with him. It was his Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to endure a Superiour, though that Superiour was his God; and theirs, to abide in thoſe Stations his Wiſdom pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in, though they were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ones, which cauſed him and them to rebel; as that wicked and unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attempt occaſioned his and their being depoſed and thrown down from the higheſt Region of Light into the loweſt Abyſs of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And as this Impiety has firſt brought on his own, ſo it inſtigated him to compaſs Mankinds Miſery. His peeviſh regretting his own calamitous Fall, and an envious diſguſt he took at Man's Felicity while innocent, and at his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Power, who had the whole lower
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35429:13"/> World ſubject to him, and all things in it put under his Feet, ſet him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon contriving, and hurried him impetuouſly on to work the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of ſo noble a Creature. For could he have endured without Grief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining to have beheld him in that Orb of Greatneſs and Happineſs, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endeavoured the degrading him from the one, or deſpoiling him of the other. His Malice took its Riſe from his Impatience to ſee that Excellency in another of which he himſelf was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and his Impatience encreas'd and enrag'd his Malice.</p>
            <p>And it was this Diſtemper which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed our firſt Progenitors to receive that fatal Wound which Satan had by that Temptation prepared to give their Felicity, and ours in them. For had our common Mother but with Patience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Onſet, and oppoſed the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his Enticements; had ſhe but perſevered in her Obedience to her Makers Command, ſhe had remain'd ſafe and ſecure; or had ſhe been afterwards qualified with this Vertue, ſhe had not derived the Contagion of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery upon our great Father.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35429:13"/>
            <p>But reſtleſs until ſhe had ſhown him the goodly forbidden Fruit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd her ſelf of all the fair Story the glozing Serpent told her of it's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and unladed it in his Ears, ſhe drew him in alſo into the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi>'s Murther of his Brother pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Impatience, which could not bear God's Acceptance of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice before his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Loſs of his Birth-right, and in that of the Priviledge of being Prieſt to the moſt High God, came from the Impatience of an incenſed Appetite, not otherwiſe to be pacified than with a Meſs of his Younger Brothers Pottage, though this Satisfaction was not to be procured on eaſier and cheaper Terms than the parting with the Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The general and ordinary Sin which provoked God to deſtroy the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, with divers Plagues, and ſundry kinds of Death, was their murmuring againſt him, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of them by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> at every Stage and almoſt every ſtep of their Journey. And what was this, but the Expreſſion of their Impatience.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35429:14"/>
            <p>Their Infidelity and Diſtruſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, while diſtreſſed for want of Water at <hi>Rephidim,</hi> they did not only<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 1, 2, 3.</note> mutiny againſt theſe Leaders for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to kill them, their Children and Cattle with Drought, but withall queſtioned his Providence,—<hi>Is the</hi>

               <hi>Lord among us or not?</hi> was the effect of their Impatience.</p>
            <p>Their making a Calf at <hi>Horeb</hi> muſt<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> be attributed to the ſame Cauſe, which would not ſuffer them to attend <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his coming down from the Mount with directions from God concerning his Worſhip, and the manner of it.</p>
            <p>A Defection from God now, which is generally committed when Men are preſſed on every ſide, and are brought to a kind of deſpairing of Relief, what is it but a want of Patience, and of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Confidence of our Hope faſt unto the end? And hath not the uſing of unlawful means to bring us out of Dangers and Troubles when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet us the ſame Original, the not patiently waiting upon the Lord to make good his Promiſes, and give us deliverance out of them all in his due ſeaſon?</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35429:14"/>
            <p>And as Impatience was and is the<note place="margin">S. 4. § 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Patience the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Vertue.</note> Fountain and Source of Evil, or rather Evil it ſelf, is but the Impatience of Good: ſo is Patience on the other ſide of all Vertue, and every good Action is but the inſtance of our Patience and Obedience. He who is ready to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<note place="margin">Of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> patiently, or does ſubmit to God's Diſpoſal of him and all his Concerns, the Inflictions and Chaſtiſements laid on him by the Divine Hand, will never diſpute his Commands, but ſtands prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to comport with every ſignification of his Will; while on the other ſide, he that repines at his Condition, frets and chafes himſelf at what befalls him contrary to his Mind, will always think the Yoak of Chriſt too heavy and cumberſom for him to wear, his Croſs too troubleſom for him to take up and carry, his Diſcipline too rigid to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>An Inſtance or two will make the Dependance of other Vertues upon this of Patience, or the requiſiteneſs of this towards the Exerciſe of them plain.</p>
            <p>That Charity which conſiſts in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving<note place="margin">Of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> Offences cannot be without it; for it's very unlikely we ſhould forgive
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35429:15"/> Offences, yea, though repeated Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and Seven times o'er, to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who thus inceſſantly injures us; nay, I may ſay it is impoſſible, unleſs we firſt inure our ſelves to bear them patiently; for if we are provoked by them to Anger, that unleſs immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allay'd, is apt to ſwell into Rancour, and that if not cured or ſuppreſſed, to break out into Revenge.</p>
            <p>Nor can that other ſort of Charity,<note place="margin">Of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Alms.</note> which ſupplies the wants of the needy, be any more without it: For he who cannot bear the leaſt blaſting of his Eſtate when God blows upon it, the ſmalleſt Diminution when it is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pleaſure to impair it, will hardly have the generous Courage to put his hand to the heap of Wealth he hath amaſs'd together, and take ſuch Sums thence which will ſerve towards the liberal and plentiful relief of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. He who hath not the Heart to bear launcing by a Chyrurgion when it is for his Health, will never venture to run a Sword through his own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and ſo boldly dare to die.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:35429:15"/>
            <p>We cannot chaſtiſe our Bodies with<note place="margin">Of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> Watchings and Faſtings, (and yet there are Offices that by our Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought many times to be practiſed in order to the keeping under our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſubduing the Fleſh to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) nor be inſtant in Prayer, caſting our ſelves thereat upon our Knees, or our Faces to the Ground, (which yet the Son of God out of a profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of his Father's awful Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did in his Supplications in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, recommending by that Example of his to us the haughty Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> the humbleſt Geſture in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that Duty) unleſs we have the Patience to endure Hunger, want of Sleep, hard lying, or the like; for by the uſe of theſe we muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go through all the Rigours and Auſterities of a ſevere Diſcipline, in which every Combatant who would get the Maſtery of his Luſts, and ſtrive lawfully, ſo as to gain the Crown of Life, ought more or leſs to exerciſe himſelf.</p>
            <p>I'll add farther, It's unlikely we ſhould<note place="margin">Of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> confeſs Jeſus Chriſt before Men (which yet we are bound to do) when upon that account we ſhall in all likelyhood

            <p>No Man's Miſery, I may ſafely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, was ever ſo violent and laſting, as not to afford him ſome Intervals of Reſt: Nor did ever any ſuffer under ſo acute and continued a Pain, as not to have ſome reſpite and Breathing-time. The Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> the bitter Waters of Sorrow never flowed in ſo faſt or ſo high upon any Souls, but that ſome time or other the Tyde turned, and they ebb'd as faſt back again, and ſank full as low.</p>
            <p>No one's Life was e'er o'ercaſt with ſuch a Blackneſs and Sadneſs, but that Light and Gladnefs broke through the Clouds, and for a Seaſon at leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all his thick Melancholly.

            <p>There is in every Man's Age a time for Laughter as well as for Sorrow, a time for clapping the Hands as well as for wringing them together; a time for taking up the Harp, the Lute, the Viol,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35429:17"/> and ſinging to them with the Voice of Melody, as well as for laying aſide theſe Inſtruments of Muſick, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Voice of Lamentation and Mourning, or the doleful Accents of Sighs and Groans. The moſt adverſe part of our Lives is commonly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſome Temperament of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: And God in his Infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath thought fit to make ſuch an alternation of Miſery and Happineſs, and Happineſs and Miſery in Humane ſtate, hath ſo ſet Day againſt Night, and Night againſt Day; Summer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Winter, and Winter againſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the Calm againſt a Tempeſt, and the Tempeſt againſt a Calm; Serene againſt Cloudy, and Cloudy againſt Serene Weather; that we ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be melted into Softneſs by having too much Sun-ſhine, nor be broken in pieces by being toſs'd in a long or violent a Storm; that neither ways we ſhould be unmann'd; that the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtroke of Adverſity, and lying under it, might the better commend the ſweetneſs of Proſperity to our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; and the interweaving or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing the Pleaſures of this, might make the hardſhip of that more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;

            <p>The juſt Reflection which <hi>Job</hi> made<note place="margin">Job 2. 10.</note> in his Miſery on this Alternation, that he who then ſo ſorely handled him, was the ſame God who e're while had ſo obligingly careſſed him, diſpoſed him to ſuſtain the heavy load of it with Patience; and ſupply'd him with a ready and very reaſonable Anſwer to return his Wife, when ſhe urged his Curſing God for Afflicting him. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh Women ſpeaketh, Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, (St. <hi>Baſil</hi> being allowed to be your Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt)<note place="margin">S. <hi>Baſil.</hi> Orat. 13.</note> Call to remembrance the good things thou once enjoyedſt, and weigh them againſt the Evil thou now ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; conſider thy former Affluence, and let that be Balance to thy preſent Wants; ſet thy former Joys againſt thy preſent Sadneſs; compare the diſturb'd and mudded Puddle thou drinkeſt of now with the clear running Streams, whoſe Waters refreſhed thee hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and thence learn this Leſſon, That the courſe of this Life is like that of a River, ſome part whereof is gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by already, ſome is now flowing by; ſome is ſtill to run into the great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35429:19"/> Abyſs of Eternity, as that empties and looſeth it ſelf in the Ocean; that thou art not to expect it ſhould keep the ſame even tenour in all it's parts, be all of a piece, all alike, clear and ſhining; no more than thou canſt look that a River ſhould every where and at all times preſerve the ſame gentle Flow, or the ſame Silver or Chryſtalline Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: No; it is only the Divine Life, which hath no Succeſſion of parts, no Intervals to divide it, that continues at one and the ſame ſtay of perpetual and immutable Happineſs.</p>
            <p>But if it were poſſible that in ſome one Perſons Life there ſhould be no ſuch Interval of Joy to divide, no ſuch Parentheſis to break off his Grief, and that he could not ſupport himſelf with any reaſonable Confidence, <hi>That as God</hi>

               <hi>had torn him, he would heal him; as he had ſmitten him, ſo he would bind him up;</hi> yet he might comfort himſelf with this Conſideration, that it could not be of very long durance, and that would in ſome degree lighten the Burthen when it ſat cloſeſt to him.</p>
            <p>It cannot be longer liv'd than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe Age extended ro the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, is but a Span long, and Death the

            <p>But if Death be not the end of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, as by our Chriſtian Faith we are perſwaded it is not; if it be not the wearied Pilgrims utmoſt Stage, yet it's the way which without any further toyl leads him to Happineſs; the very Gate which opens upon it; his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guide, which conducts him to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35429:20"/> of Immortal Glory; his kind Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, which gives him actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them; inſtates and ſettles him in them: So that if weeping en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a night, (the ſhort night of our ſojourning here; a Night o'ercaſt with Darkneſs rather than a Day; the Shadow of Death rather than the Light of Life) yet Joy cometh in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Morning of our Souls Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in which, diſcharged from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of their Bodies, they begin firſt truly to live; or in the Morning of the Reſurrection, in which our Bodies ſhall ſpring up again, like the tender Herb impregnated by the Morning Dew, and quickened with a vital warmth from it's Mother Earth, and flouriſh in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fading Verdure. Add beſides, that as no Temptation can befal us, but what is common to Men, and that it's leſs than Childiſhneſs to lament with a Woe and Alas, when we ſuffer the common Incidents of Mortality, and that Death which cannot be at a long Diſtance from any, will put a Period to them; ſo God <hi>who is faithful, will not ſuffer</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>us to be tempted above what we are able, but will with the temptation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

            <p>But let the weight of Miſery be<note place="margin">So born, it becomes lighter.</note> what it will, it's Burthen as great as is imaginable, yet they are made lighter and our Condition under them eaſier, by ſupporting them with Patience, which is a farther encouragement to the doing this: I might ſay, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the new load Impatience adds, and the uneaſineſs that creates, it alters the nature of ſuffering, changes Pain, and Torment into Pleaſure, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, into Recreation, Judgment into Kindneſs and Mercy.</p>
            <p>For it's not the Stroke, while we are ſmitten by God, or lie under his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting hand, ſo much as our froward Carriage, that cauſeth the ſmart. This makes the Stripes look angry and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; this envenoms, feſters and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours them; as the wounded Deer, the more he ſtirrs, the more the Arrow which pierced his ſides galls him.</p>
            <p>The Burthen, the Yoak, the Croſs, the utmoſt harſhneſs and ſharpneſs with which God diſciplines us here born with an even quiet mind, become light, ſoft and gentle.</p>

            <p>Very uſe and cuſtom in ſuffering have<note place="margin">Cic. 3. Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul.</note> power enough not only to qualifie, but to alter the nature of it, and render it well nigh grateful; whence we may rationally conclude, that a patient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the wiſe and gracious Will of the Impoſer may be able to work the ſame; yea, a ſtronger Effect, and introduce a nobler degree of change.</p>
            <p>For thus it hath been obſerved, that Slaves who have ſigh'd deeply when they were firſt condemned to the Galleys, have ſometime after ſung, while being chained they tugged at their Bank of Oars; that Men who were afraid at firſt to put out to Sea in a Calm, have by frequenting it learn'd to laugh in Storms; that ſuch unfortunate Wretches, who ſentenced to work in the Mines, have been fain to be driven and goaded on as it were to their labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Task (ſo reluctant was their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Service at firſt) have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome compaſs of time after wrought in them with as much chearfulneſs, as if they had been the abſolute Lords and Maſters of all the rich Oar they digged up; that ſuch miſerable Slaves, who doom'd to the Fencing School, have hung back as if they had been
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35429:22"/> going to the Slaughter-houſe to have been butchered immediately; after a little inuring themſelves to the bloody Combats there exhibited, have not ſo much as cried, Oh! when fighting a Prize they themſelves have been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded; or ſo much as changed Colour, or ſhrunk in their Neck, when fell'd to the Ground, their Antagoniſt's Weapon was at their Throat.</p>
            <p>The Noble <hi>Spartan</hi> Youths, when according to their Country's ſevere Diſcipline inſtituted to harden them, they were ſcourged at the Altar till the Blood ſtreamed out, yea, ſometimes till they died under their Stripes, were ſo far from roaring out, that they fetch'd not a Groan.</p>
            <p>And now ſhall not Perſons of mature Age and Judgment behave themſelves as decently in the point of enduring Pain, as raw Boys or green Youths? Or ſhall not Reaſon ſway us as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully in this as Uſage did them? Or ſhall not Religion and Grace work as effectually in us as ever Reaſon or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom did or can?</p>
            <p>Beſides Time it ſelf abates the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Calamity, tames the moſt ſtubborn and obſtinate Grief: And is it fit we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35429:22"/> ſhould be beholden to Time to do that for us, which we might do our ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> to put an end to our Sorrow? Shall we ſtay for that to do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Wills, which we ought to do of our own accord? Why ſhould we not rather by wiſe Conſiderations ſnatch the Glory of this from Time, and out of Prudence ſurceaſe from that which length of days will oblige us to?</p>
            <p>Certainly if ſuch be the prevailing Force of Cuſtom or Time as to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Afflictions, a quiet bearing them upon a juſt Eſtimate of their Nature, that they are never intrinſecally Evil, and often operative of Good, may be reaſonably concluded to be more powerful to effect this, or even to change their Quality, eſpecially when beſides it's own Vertue compleatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to this Service, it ſhall have the the Aſſiſtance of Time to produce it.</p>
            <p>(4.) The Advantages accruing from<note place="margin">S. 4. § 4. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Illuſtrated by Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence turn to good Account, whereby Impatience renders imaginary ones real, and augments real ones.</note> poſſeſſing our Souls in Patience may be another Argument to induce us to do ſo. For the Evils we ſuffer are either
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35429:23"/> not real, or more in Imagination than Truth, But whether true, or whether they lie in Opinion meerly, they may always by bearing them patiently, which is the making the right uſe of them, turn to good Account. This Vertue is the beſt Defenſative againſt the Laſhes of a malignant Tongue, or the rude Blows of the hand of Violence when it is lifted up to ſtrike, or the foot of Pride to ſpurn at us, that they do us no miſchief. This covers us againſt all the Engines and Inſtruments of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or renders us invulnerable from them; and that not by working a <hi>Stoical</hi> Apathy in us, by bereaving us of our Senſes, eradicating our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſpoyling us of Humanity, ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us into Stocks, hardening us into Stones or Adamants, leaving us in the mean time only the Figure of Men; but by introducing an imperturbation of Mind when we have the greateſt Provocations to diſquiet us, and are the moſt ſenſible of them.</p>
            <p>Fortify'd with this, all the poyſoned Arrows of Slander and Reproach which are directed, all the Weapons of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which are levelled againſt us, will be no more able to hurt us, than
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35429:23"/> Darts thrown againſt a Brazen Wall; nay, like them they will recoyl back upon the injurious Contrivers of them, and wound them; the Shafts of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity will be ſo far from piercing this Coat of Mail, that it will repel them back with greater Force than they came; by it we are not only made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable againſt Diſaſters, but more than Conquerors over them.</p>
            <p>Whereas Impatience under Wrongs<note place="margin">

For without peradventure they intended by them to diſcompoſe and moleſt, to vex and fret us, and we unwiſely by Impatience concur with and gratifie them in their deſign, fairly ſuffer, or rather aſſiſt them to get their Ends by diſturbing our ſelves.</p>
            <p>While the not taking notice of their Injuries would be a ſufficient revenging our ſelves upon them; for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to themſelves in doing them the grieving of us; which if they ſee they cannot affect, they will torment

            <p>The poyſonous Tongue of the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, inſtead of blackning and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kring, may brighten and poliſh our Reputation, if we will not heed his Calumnies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> underſtood this well, when he made no other Reply to one who had rail'd bitterly upon him, and thought to provoke him, but this, <hi>It's in your power to ſpeak ill of me, but in mine to bear it quietly.</hi> And <hi>Socrates,</hi> who meeting <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ridiculed him as much as he could upon the Stage, inſtead of being incens'd at him for this ill uſe, ask'd him only, <hi>If he had occaſion to uſe him again to any ſuch like purpoſe of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry?</hi>

            <p>Other Ills likewiſe, as we term them, may turn to our Advantage, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that conſideration ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Patience.</p>

The Tryal of our Faith by Fire, is that it may be found unto Peace, and <hi>Honour, and Glory, at the appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7.</p>

            <p>They are Words of one deſpairing to make any Reformation, which God uſeth by <hi>Ezechiel, (Ez. 16. 42.) For I will make my fury towards thee to rest, and my Jealouſie ſhall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</hi> There is nothing remains, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Eſſays have been fruitleſs, and thereupon God declines to put any thing more of this kind in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but an utter Deſtruction of a Perſon or Nation.

His Reaſon for this touch'd not only his Scholar, but reach'd all Mankind; and ſhews that they are therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to obſerve the Direction: For becauſe of the hideous Darkneſs which benights our Underſterſtandings, we may ask things pernicious to our ſtate, and ſo better have never moved for them, or never had them granted us. For example, We may ask Riches for our ſelves, which have undone ſo many thouſands who have thirſted for them, and laboured after them to cool that furious heat of Covetouſneſs; Honours, which have broke ſo many men's Sleep and Brains in aſpiring after them; Kingdoms, which have brought ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawful Princes as well as uſurping Tyrants to woful Tragical Ends; Wives, who have not more enriched or ennobled more Families with their plentiful Fortunes or high Alliances, than they have ruined and diſgraced with their expenſive Luxury and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35429:39"/> Practices; whereas he who could eaſily give, would in his Wiſdom chuſe to beſtow that, which if not ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, would be always moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us.</p>

            <p>And the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> way of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was of Affinity to this, who whether in their Publick or Private Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies were never obſerved to Petition their Gods for more, than that they would do thoſe things which were good, and ſuperadd the Grant of thoſe which were of fair eſteem.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35429:40"/> with the ſame indifferency, as a Traveller applies himſelf to ask the way of thoſe he thinks can direct him, not caring on which hand it lies, much leſs, vainly wiſhing that it might be on this hand, rather than on that; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring only to be ſhew'd the beſt and neareſt Road that leads to the place for which he deſigns; ſo we ſhould ask of him to diſpence what may moſt conduce to our Happineſs without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous, leaſt of all ſollicitous, that it may be this or that, rather than ſome other thing.</p>
            <p>And his Rebuke of thoſe who behave themſelves otherwiſe, is no leſs ſharp than his former Direction was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; of thoſe who implore God's pity to relieve them, and redreſs their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afflicted condition; either changing it, or delivering them out of it.—<hi>Vile Wretches,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what would you be at?

            <p>The Conſideration of God's Wiſdom which furniſhes him with an exact knowledge of the Diſeaſes of our Souls, and the proper Cures for them, ſhould make us perfectly comply with the Methods he takes, or the Courſe of Phyſick he preſcribes; quietly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, and patiently to undergo the uſe and application of the Remedies he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects for the reſtoring them to their Health; as Perſons in Bodily Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or Infirmities give themſelves up into the hands of a skilful Phyſician or Chyrurgion, whoſe Art and Experience makes them much better acquainted with the Nature and Cure of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Maladies than they themſelves, and ſubmit upon the Confidence of this to all their Operations and ways of Practice, to their Corroſives, Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Cauſticks, as well as to their Demulſions and Infuſions, to their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as ſweet, to their mild as well as ſharp Potions.</p>

            <p>And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> aſſigns this Reaſon, why God doth not immediately give us thoſe things which we ask accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will, becauſe his Wiſdom ſees it is not a proper Seaſon for us to have them, and therefore not for him to beſtow them. As a Phyſician refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Patient under a Calenture a cooling Julep he calls for, not for that he judgeth it's unſerviceable to allay the ſcorching Heats of his Diſtemper, but becauſe the time he calls for it is not ſo proper for the Adminiſtration of it.

            </p>
            <p>Having therefore a firm Belief, as we ought to have, that God is eſſentially and immutably good in himſelf; and that thereupon this overflowing Fountain of Goodneſs is beneficially good to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and without himſelf; we can do no other than conclude, that whatever ſuch an one doth, who is thus Entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and Communicatively good, muſt of neceſſity be really good too; and that it's our Miſtake and Error when we think or call it ill.</p>

            <p>The weighing of God's Omnipotence, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, ſingly and apart by themſelves, would each of them ſupply us with a convincing Reaſon, that we ought quietly to ſubmit to the Rod of God when he lays it upon our backs, and patiently receive the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he inflicts; much more efficacious then muſt the putting of all theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments into the Scale together be to ſatisfie us of the reaſonableneſs of doing ſo: For what other Remedy, I will not ſay, what better can we deviſe to oppoſe againſt Calamities ſent by Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, than patiently to bear them; as we do the Rigours of Winter Froſts, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35429:44"/> the extreme Heats of the Summer, or any other Inclemency of the Seaſon or Weather?</p>
            <p>Or what can we do wiſer, than to acquieſce in the Choice which Infinite Wiſdom hath made for us, and take the Lot it hath aſſigned us? Or what can we do more reaſonably, than content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to abide in the Station where boundleſs Goodneſs hath placed us? Without queſtion we can do nothing better, wiſer, reaſonablener, than thus to deport our ſelves: For Omnipotence is not to be controlled, much leſs can our Weakneſs make any Reſiſtance to it. Infinite Wiſdom cannot be miſtaken in its Ends or Meaſures, nor can infinite Goodneſs do an unkind Act. His All-ſufficiency makes him the full Poſſeſſor of all good things. His Almightineſs able to beſtow them; and his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which knows no Bounds, willing to impart and communicate them.</p>
            <p>And then, why ſhould we abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine that he who hath them to give, and hath likewiſe Power and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Will and Inclinations to do ſo, ſhould not beſtow them on us? Could a Heathen Philoſopher upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Belief argue thus; our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35429:45"/> then muſt be falſe, if we conceive otherwiſe, and our Practice which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſo blind a Guide muſt needs be extremely wrong.</p>
            <p>But if we have right Thoughts of God in this point, and yet in the mean while that we believe he diſpenſeth what is beſt for us, we under that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpenſation behave our ſelves fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, we muſt be at an odd Strife with our ſelves, our Actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting our Judgment, which ſhould direct and govern them; and our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemning our Actions, whoſe Approbation they ſhould have.</p>

            <p>Such a Pattern of long-ſuffering hath God ſhew'd himſelf to Sinners, that many have taken the occaſion thence to perſwade themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there was no ſuch being as a Deity, becauſe they ſaw no marks of his Diſpleaſure ſent on thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and deſerved to feel it moſt: Nay, thoſe very Wretches themſelves

            <p>And indeed, if the Concluſion could have been rightly inferr'd from their eſcaping his Anger, the Confidence they took to ſin was very agreeable to it.</p>
            <p>Such an one was <hi>Selius</hi> in the Poet,<note place="margin">Martial. l. 4.

            <p>But he hath not thought it enough to ſet himſelf for a Pattern of long-ſuffering under all the Inſults and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts done to his Majeſty, Power, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Holineſs by ungodly Men; but he hath likewiſe ſet himſelf an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Goodneſs and Benificence to the inſolent and injurious; ſo he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts himſelf to be, in cauſing the Sun, Moon and Stars to diſpence their Light and Heat, and to ſhed abroad all their kind, benign Influences for their Uſe and Service as well as of others, while he exactly divides and apportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates his healthful, fruitful Seaſons to both alike; while with the ſame equal Favour he watereth the Hills from his Chambers; ſendeth the Springs to run<note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 13</note> among them, and theſe augmented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rivers, to enrich as well as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with their long courſe the ſubjacent Plains; commands the Clouds to drop Fatneſs on both, ſpreads the Paſtures over with Flocks, covers the Valleys ſo thick with Corn or Graſs, as that they ſhout for joy, and laugh and ſing;<note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 13</note> cauſeth the Trees bearing Fruit to hang

            <p>And now if God patiently endures the daily, the hourly, the conſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities of all us Offenders; yea, even of the haughtieſt Sinners, ſuch who proudly call in queſtion his Being, or peremptorily deny or ſaucily flout at it; while he could do himſelf Juſtice every moment in our Deſtruction, chooſing rather to expect, as well as<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> deſigning that this forbearance ſhould lead us to Repentance, than utterly to ſlay us; if, over and above this, he is ſeveral ways kind and indulgent to us and them, we have the ſtrongeſt Inducements that Example can afford, or indeed the ſtricteſt Obligations that Juſtice can lay upon us, ſo to behave our ſelves towards him as he deals with us; and as he patiently bears with our Sins, while he might immediately ſend abroad his Judgments, and ſtrike us dead in

            <p>All the time that he executed his Prophetick Office among his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 3.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> to whom he was ſent, he endured with much Long ſuffering the Contradiction of Sinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 11.</note> (<hi>for his own received him not</hi>) and attended the Correction of their crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverſe Nature, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their corrupted Manners.</p>
            <p>This good Shepherd ſent to ſeek after the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had gone aſtray from his Fathers Folds, and the wholſom and pleaſant Paſtures of his Providing, into a barren Feeding, a very Wilderneſs of Thorns and Briars, who had, ſwerving from his moſt excellent Rules and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions, turn'd aſide to the obſervation of vain and humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, followed the Imaginations of their own darkned and miſguided Hearts, made and continued this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to recover them with unwearied Patience.</p>

            <p>Amidſt the ſharp Pains of the Croſs which entred into his Soul, as the Iron did into his Body, the Nails into his Fleſh, his Mind was as ſerene and calm as if he had been altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible, and inſenſible of them.

            <p>Thus he comforted his Diſciples by his Example in bearing his Croſs, and bearing it in this wiſe, to incline them to take it up; and confirmed them in the reſolution of Martyrdom, as well as exhorted them to it.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:35429:60"/>
            <p>And as he thus manifeſted his Patience in enduring in his Life Poverty, and all the Inconveniences and the Hardſhips with the Contempt, which are the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of that low Condition, and at his Death all Pains, and the more cruel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of malicious envenomed Foes; ſo in the days of his Fleſh he expreſſed<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 31</note> another ſort of Patience; expecting with much long-ſuffering the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſirous to gather them under the Shadow of his Wings; as a Hen gathereth her Chickens in order to ſave them from his Fathers Wrath, and their deſerved Deſtruction; and this, even after, and notwithſtanding they had killed the Prophets, and ſton'd the Meſſengers that were ſent unto them to foretel and prepare them for this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of his deſigned to heal them.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, after he was taken up<note place="margin">Acts 2. Acts 4.</note> from among them who had Crucify'd him the Lord of Life, and murthered him their Prince and Saviour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into Heaven, and exalted by his Father to the Right Hand of his Power and Majeſty, he gave a ſignal Proof of this in waiting Forty Years for their Repentance and Converſion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35429:60"/> before he ſent the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies to take Vengeance of them for his own innocent Blood, and that of his Saints poured out like Water round about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and for the reſt of their enormous Impieties. And even now at this time, in this ſtate of Exaltation, while he ſets crown'd with Honour and Glory on the Right Hand of the Throne of his Father; he in mercy ſtill ſtretcheth out his healing Wings over them, earneſtly deſiring they would accept of Covert under them, coming to him by Faith, and looking for Salvation in his Name, and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; in mercy he defers and prorogues the time of his returning back to his laſt and eternal Judgment, out of a ſpecial Tenderneſs and Compaſſion to them, as well as a general one to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, willing that none ſhould periſh, but willing that all, even the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and obdurate, ſhould through the Obedience of Faith, and ſoftned by Repentance, come to everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it may be pleaded in Bar, or pretended in excuſe for not imitating the Example of our great Lord and Maſter, that the Shine of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35429:61"/> his Virtues, even breaking through the dark ſhrowd of his Fleſh, is ſo ſtrong and bright, as they dazle our weak Eyes, and we cannot look upon them with a ſtedfaſtneſs fit for the copying them; that they are too ſublime and excellent to be tranſcribed by Men ſubject to, and encompaſs'd with Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Infirmities; nay, made up of them as much as of Fleſh and Blood; though he dwelt among us to ſet us a Pattern, as much as to inſtruct us, and ſuffered to leave us an Example, as well as to lay down a Price for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. (And although St. <hi>Peter</hi> thought not his Wife too weak to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it in ſome meaſure, when ſeeing her carried to ſuffer Death, he encouraged her to it, by reminding her of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.)

            <p>Then indeed his Patience, which had ſtood impregnable againſt all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Aſſaults, unſhaken againſt all the recited Storms and Tempeſts of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, which beat upon him, moved him to an Indignation of her Advice, and that inſtigated him to give her a

            <p>But I forbear, as loath to diſgrace and ſhame my ſelf and Fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who cannot look back on, or remember them without Bluſhes and Confuſion, to obſerve our ſelves with all the Advantages of more excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and the encouragement of Nobler Rewards, ſurpaſſed and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by them who had no better Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances to further them in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Virtue than Nature and Reaſon, the one weak and depraved, the other dim and blear-ey'd; nor any other Incentives to excite them, no other Motives to animate them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, than what a thirſt after Glory kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, or a deſire to excel others inſpired.</p>

            <p>Let us run the race of our Chriſtian Life, how rough, how full of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, how ſurrounded with Terrors and Dangers ſoever it may be, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it as ſet before us by God with an Obligation to run it; that without running it there is no poſſibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the glorious Prize for which it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35429:70"/> was inſtituted. For Running is pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the fundamental Article and Condition to all others that are to be performed for the obtaining it, and are propounded for an Encouragement to run; and without running it with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, there can be no more carrying it away; for it hangs upon the Goal, and is to be taken thence by ſuch only who run as far as that, which is not to be done without Patience; foraſmuch as not ſupported by her Aſſiſtance, we ſhall grow faint and weary before we reach thither.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Certainly would we but take ſo much time as would ſerve to look round about us, and view that Army with Banners, which from the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church encompaſs us; that Cloud of Witneſſes which from theſe two Coaſts overſhadow us; them eſpecially who have run the very ſame Race that is now before us with Patience, and for having done ſo, enjoy now a delightful Reſt from all their Labours, never to be diſturbed any more; are in the actual Poſſeſſion of an indefeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inalienable Happineſs; or as would ſerve to look upwards to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, the Inſtitutor and Rewarder of it; and contemplate him, who for having deſpiſed the Torment and Scandal of the Croſs, eſteemed its Diſgrace a Glory, and its Pains a Pleaſure, with reſpect to his Fathers Will and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he ſhould ſuffer this; and regard to the Glory he deſigned him for a Reward of his humble and patient Obedience, is ſeated on the right hand of the Throne of Majeſty in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens, we ſhould through ſuch a Contemplation be animated to run

            <p>Let us therefore, my Fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Soldiers, bravely on after the Captain of our Salvation, where-ever he by his great Example leads the way, not turning our Backs through Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, or lagging behind through Sluggiſhneſs; foraſmuch as on one hand it is a Reproach and a Crime too for Soldiers not to follow their Leaders; and on the other, having maſtered the Toyl of a ſhort March o'er this Spot of Earth, arrive we ſhall at Heaven, a Seat whoſe Manſions (for there are many) ſhall yield us everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments.</p>
            <p>Let us follow ſuch who engaged in the ſame Warfare for which we have enrolled our Names, have gone before us treading in the ſteps of their, and our great General; let us, as they did, I mean the Martyrs and Confeſſors of the ſeveral Ages of the Church, keep cloſe to, and fight under his Imperial Banner, the Croſs; who for having by the Exploits they did, and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips they ſuffered, acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bravely, as good Soldiers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, are now with him their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious

            <p>Indeed having Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the neceſſity and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this Duty; having ſuch Motives of Pleaſure and Advantage to encourage us to the exerciſe of it; having Examples on all hands, of the Patriarchs and Prophets before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours taking Fleſh, and dwelling among us; of himſelf in the days of his Fleſh and Humiliation; and of his Diſciples, and all other holy Perſons who have ſucceeded ſince the time that he was taken up into Heaven, and received into Glory even until now, to excite us to the Practice of it; it is almoſt impoſſible, if we will attend to them, but that we ſhould emulate them; and upon meeting with the ſame occaſions as they did, imitate them in the ſame virtue too; and either living poſſeſs our Souls in Patience as they did; or dying, after their Example, ſo reſign them.</p>
            <p>That we may therefore do ſo upon all Emergencies which require it, it will be needful to have all in readineſs

            <p>No doubt there is to be made, but ſuch a ſetled Opinion as this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher conceived of God's bringing us into the World for this very end, to enter the Liſts with Adverſity, and his being a Spectator of the Fight, is of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Force to make us behave our ſelves gallantly.

            <p>The Advice though coming from a <hi>Comoedian</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage, may be of great uſe for the Conduct of our Lives; and thence we may learn not only to eſteem Misfortunes and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as the familiar Companions of Humane Condition as belonging to it's Retinue; but frequently take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them in our Thoughts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them before-hand as ſuch, that when they actually lighten upon us, we may be Maſters of our ſelves and our Faculties, poſſeſs our Minds in all Sedateneſs, neither be diſturbed by Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor provoked by Anger, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Puſillanimity.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35429:75"/> for he had figured to himſelf all the kinds of them, and taken a view of them in his mind.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe in eaſie we ſhould think of hard Times, in the Flow of Plenty and Riches muſe of Poverty and Want; amidſt the Smiles and Blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fortune, as we term the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well of things on our part, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend her Frowns and Severity.</p>

            <p>In Proſperity we ſhould arm our ſelves againſt the ſtroke of Adverſity; as the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers uſed in time of<note place="margin">Veget. de re milit. l. 1. c. 8.</note> Peace to carry Baskets of Earth and Palliſadoes, as if they had been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp againſt an Enemy, to march once every Month Ten Miles a day in their Arms, as if they had been to fight; and to leap on and off their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35429:76"/> Wooden Horſes, as if they had been engaged in Battel; in ſhort, to practiſe all the Arts, and endure all the Toyls of War, that they might be the more expert to manage live Horſes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves in a real Fight, and the better inured to bear all it's true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigues and hardſhips; or as thoſe whom that State entertained for Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſerve on board their Fleet in the time of the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, learnt to ply their Oars while their Galleys were a building in their Docks, or equipping in their Harbours.</p>
            <p>While we are encompaſſed with a multitude of Friends, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that either they may forſake us upon ſome Diſtaſte or Diſaſter; or if their Conſtancy be ſo immovable, as they will not abandon us, yet they may be taken from us, becauſe they are but Earth animated with a little warm Breath for a time, and were born to die either before or after us; and that it's no more for what is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſometime or other to die, than it is that a brittle Cup or Glaſs ſhould be broken in uſing at one time or other. And ſo we are to prepare our ſelves for receiving the loſs of other things, by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35429:76"/> thinking upon their Nature, that they are in themſelves corruptible and amiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and that the Sum of every mans Life, however it may ſeem diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by variety of Accidents, upon a juſt Calculation, will be found to be the ſame at the foot of the Account; the frail Creatures who ſhould periſh themſelves received Goods which ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>And that it's unreaſonable to expect to be exempted from the common ſhare of Misfortunes, abſurd to look to be priviledged above the reſt of Mankind; at the beſt, a groundleſs aſſuming to our ſelves to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Favourites of God, and that the Dew of Heaven was to fall upon our Fleeces, while all about us was dry, that neither our Garments or our Hairs ſhould be ſinged, or the ſmell of Fire paſs upon us, while we walk'd in the Flames, though they ſhould conſume others.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the Contemplation of the inevitableneſs of Calamity of one kind or other, not to be prevented by any Art or Care, prepares us againſt the time it makes its Aſſaults, and puts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a poſture to receive it; weakens and abates it's force when it actually makes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35429:77"/> the Impreſſion; and moderates our Paſſions ſo, that they do not aid nor joyn with it to diſturb us; and that the attending in our Thoughts to God's being a Spectator from on high how we behave our ſelves, is what will give us new Life and Courage in the Conteſt. (For it was this Thought,<note place="margin">Minut. Foel. Dialog.</note> as <hi>Caecilius</hi> hath obſerved, which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Chriſtians Courage above the Threats of their Enemies, their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above the Power of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Pleaſure above the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Torments they endured, made them inſult over their Judges as they condemn'd them, contemn the Grimneſs and Horror of their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner's Face and Dreſs, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful Horror with which their Death was ſet out, which all inſtructed them to gain what they contended for, the Crown of Martyrdom.) It would be no leſs advantageous than commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable piece of Prudence to make the one the frequent Subject of our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and to ſet the other before our Thoughts as an Obſerver of our Deportment, in order to be a Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it as a Judge hereafter.</p>

For, as it is well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Eliphaz, Affliction cometh not out of the Duſt, neither doth Trouble<note place="margin">Job 5. 6.</note> ſpring out of the ground; i. e.</hi> Their Original is not fortuitous, as that of Muſhrooms or Weeds, or the like things, (which ſhoot out of the Earth all of a ſudden in a night, or a Thunder Shower, or things without any Order and Method) ſeems to be: Nor yet have they a natural Cauſe, as Plants propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from their proper Seeds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Ground, and form'd and actuated by it's ſeminal Vertue have; but a moral and meritorious one, which is our ſins.</p>
            <p>The Tranſgreſſion of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents gave the firſt Riſe to Trouble, brought it with it ſelf as a Companion or Attendant into the World, or drew it after its ſelf as its proper Reward.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:35429:78"/>
            <p>Then by way of equal Recompence for having eat of that Fruit God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them, he condemned Man to eat for ever after of the Fruit of the Ground in the Sweat of his Brow; and the Woman to bring forth hers<note place="margin">Job 5. 6. Gen. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> (for Children are the Fruits of the Womb) in Pangs and Sorrow.</p>

            <p>Immediately upon this, as the Earth by God's Curſe upon it for Man's ſake brought forth Briars and Thorns to moleſt him, which is what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirms; and prickles began to grow up with the Roſe-tree to ſcratch their Hands if they would gather them, which is what St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35429:78"/> and tear their Minds.

            <p>Since therefore God was provoked at firſt by Man's Impieties and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to treat him ſo roughly; and the daily renewing of thoſe provokes him now to repeat the ſame uſage; we ought in all reaſon to bear the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we have brought upon our ſelves by our ſins, eſpecially ſince we have not been only caution'd againſt every one of them by a direct or virtual, but plain Prohibition of them, but had expreſs notice of thoſe very diſmal Conſequences being entailed upon them.</p>

            <p>For that we are inclin'd thus to vent our Paſſions againſt the Deity, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually do ſo while we ſuffer from him, if our low Opinion of our own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo conſequently of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthily what we do, and leſs than what we have merited, reſtrains us not

And then advancing farther upon that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake and wrong Inference, cry out, What have we to do with him? For either he cannot help us out of our Miſeries; or if he can, he will not, which is worſe: And this proceeding from this careleſs neglect, they at laſt arrive at a down-right Defiance of him, declaiming againſt building of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and rearing Altars to him; and take upon them to maintain, That they have no more reaſon to worſhip him than Fevers which moleſt them, or Ghoſts which haunt them.</p>
            <p>Thus thoſe in the <hi>Revelation</hi> on whom the Angels emptied ſome of the Vials of God's Judgments, blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their Pains<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 11</note> and of their Soars.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:35429:84"/>
            <p>But if it were poſſible to bear the Ills of this Life patiently, without a profound and humble Sence of our own baſeneſs, ſuch as renders us worthy to ſuffer them, and more; yet as this falſe Gallantry would be but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of this Vertue, not it; ſo it would not hold out to the laſt, but would flinch and recoyl ſometime or other, or betray it's ſelf by its win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in private, or by it's open Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>That Philoſopher, who unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had bore all the Contumelies and Reproaches which a Perſon, who had a mind to try his Patience, could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to heap upon him, when he told his provoking Adverſary, <hi>Now, Sir, I hope you are ſatiisfied I am a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher:</hi> Received this ſharp Retort from him, <hi>I had indeed, had you been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi>

            <p>We are farther to conſider, That as<note place="margin">N. 3.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35429:84"/> provoke his Anger to aggravate the Inflictions, and to create a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on purpoſe for the Chaſtiſement of a new Sin, our Impatience. As Maſters and Parents are oft ſtirred up by the Obſtinacy and Frowardneſs of their Servants or Childron to correct them more ſeverely than at firſt they deſigned.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if we were not aw'd through this Conſideration, inſtead of a meek and humble Deportment of our ſelves, inſtead of an even and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Temper, we ſhould be ready in high Diſcontent and Fury to caſt about with our ſelves, whether we might not ſome way or other, in diſpight of him, wind our ſelves out of our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

            <p>And if a Prophet of ſo great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity was thus violently carried away unto a diſcarding God as it were, at leaſt from being the God of his hope, it will be no Marvail if ſome, nay, if multitudes are ſo ill-diſpoſed, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Perſon in the Poet was, That when they cannot incline Heaven to eaſe them, they will ſeek for a Relief from Hell, knock at its Gates, and try the Power and Mercy of Devils either to deliver them out of their Troubles, or rebate them.</p>

            <p>The Divine Wiſdom hath appointed<note place="margin">N. 1. 2 Tim. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that all who would live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhould ſuffer Perſecution;</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of one ſort or other, of the Tongue or the Sword, from Enemies
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35429:86"/> or from Croſſes; it hath made <hi>this way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19. 23. Mat. 7. 13.</note> as it is eminently call'd, always rough, by reaſon of its Precepts and Reſtraints very irkſom and repugnant to Fleſh and Blood; and in every part of it ſtreight and narrow, allowing no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do the leaſt Evil, though the moſt grateful and acceptable to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations or Temper; though the moſt profitable and advantagious, and ſuch as ſhall be compenſated with a publick Good; and ſometimes extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to thoſe who take it, and dare own they do ſo, and will not be put out of it.</p>
            <p>And he hath made it thus, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the taking up of the Croſs as a Condition of our Profeſſion, or of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to it for the Trial of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which could not be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, if every thing he required was ſuitable to our own Minds, and the recommendation of it likewiſe, which would be very inſignificant, and not thank-worthy, if the way of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments was all on a Carpet, ſtrew'd with Roſes, and thoſe without any Prickles, or all as ſoft as down; yea, hardly deſerve that Name, if it were not to be exerciſed and manifeſted in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35429:86"/> ſome Inſtances of Difficulty and Peril. And indeed this laſt hath been deem'd ſo neceſſary to our Chriſtianity, that the very Blood which flow'd from the opened Pores of our Saviours natural Body in his Agony, hath been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a Signification and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">S. Proſper Sentent. ex Auguſt.</note> of the Blood which ſhould flow from all the parts of his Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Church.</p>
            <p>And now what is that Man, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects God ſhould make a way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven free from ſuch Hardſhips for his uſe only. He is too tender to be a Chriſtian, who thinks to go eaſily to Heaven, or too much a Fool in eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Pleaſure, which the World miſcalls ſo.</p>
            <p>However it is certain, that we are bound by all the Ties and Force of Gratitude to lay down our Lives for him in return of his Love, who laid down his Life for us; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Example of his, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 16 4. 11.</note> any particular Precept ſo to do: For if we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren, reflecting that he laid down his Life for us; much more ſtrongly muſt we be ebliged by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35429:87"/> of ſo great Love, to lay down our Lives for him.</p>
            <p>And this Obligation reaches to two Caſes more peculiarly; either (1.) When the parting with our Lives is the only convincing Argument we can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Proof of the Truth and Sincerity of our own Faith. Or, (2.) When ſuch an Oblation is neceſſary for the Service of our Brethren's Faith; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely or highly requiſite to ſuſtain their ſtaggering Faith that it ſink not, or to preſerve their languiſhing one, that it doth not finally fail.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch occaſions as theſe we are to do what St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>fill up what</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>is behind of the Afflictions of Christ in our Fleſh,</hi> (even by ſuffering in it) <hi>for his Bodies ſake, which is the Church;</hi> not as if there was any thing deficient in his perſonal Sufferings to render his Satisfaction and Reconciliation through it compleat, and we could ſupply it; but that we might help to fill up that meaſure of Sufferings which his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body of the Church, (with which he is one Perſon) was appointed by the Father to undergo by way of Service, Probation, Confirmation or Example.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:35429:87"/>
            <p>We our ſelves have agreed to carry<note place="margin">N. 2. From a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves.</note> Chriſt's Yoak, how heavy ſoever he ſhould make it; have entred into Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of ſuffering all the Hardſhips of this Warfare, even of reſiſting unto Blood: We did ſo when we took him to be our Maſter, when we liſted our ſelves to be the Soldiers of Chriſt, and ſo are under a neceſſity of fulfilling them. We engaged then to fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully under his Croſs, even unto Death; for what elſe can the <hi>continuing his Faithful Soldiers unto our Lives end</hi> imply? We ſubmitted to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propounded by him, of taking up his Croſs and bearing it after him, and following him in the way that he went before, and promiſed Performance.</p>
            <p>We vow'd and devoted our ſelves, as to all other Sufferings, ſo to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom eſpecially: And as by vertue of that Dedication we ought conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Martyrs in reſolution, while we have not the occaſion of conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that Vow, and making an actual Oblation of our Blood, as the Blood of the ſlain Victims was poured out upon the Altar, and ſo offered to to him; or of giving up our Bodies to be burnt, as their Fleſh was conſumed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35429:88"/> in the Fire; ſo when we have the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion preſented to us, we are bound to comply with it; and at that time if we do, we ſhall be accepted as Martyrs by him, and rewarded with their Crowns.</p>
            <p>Upon both of theſe Accounts then it remains, that we our ſelves knowing (as having bin therewith acquainted before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by our great Lord and Maſter) that<note place="margin">1 Theſſ 3 3</note> we are appointed unto Afflictions, ought not to be thereat moved; and having beſides ſubmitted our ſelves to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are not to <hi>reckon the Fiery Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al which is to try us, strange,</hi> or be<note place="margin">1 Pei. 4. 12</note> ſurprized when we are put upon it, or that kind of Queſtion actually admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to us, as if ſome ſtrange thing hapned unto us.</p>
            <p>And if Premonitions and Advice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand will leave no room for a Surprizal with Wonder or Amazement; nor our own Engagements to ſuffer, any place for Fear to ſeize us when Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do actually fall upon us; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will take from us all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Excuſe or Colour of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we are impatient under them; but moſt infallibly deprive us of the Honour of Martyrdom and its Reward,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35429:88"/> whatever be the fair opportunity which invites us to embrace it: For Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuffering looks to have ſo much Averſion on one hand, and Conſtraint on the other, as is not conſiſtent with Martyrdom, which muſt be a Free-will Offering, and a chearful one, at leaſt not ſo with that Charity, which muſt commend the Oblation of our ſelves to God's acceptance. The Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Man, though they be unto Death, and even for the Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, can never be an Offering of a <hi>ſweet Savour, acceptable to God,</hi> any more than a Beaſt that was haled and dragged to the Altar, was ever reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd of old to make an acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to an Idol.</p>
            <p>But beſides looking back and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering<note place="margin">§. 7. § 4. Conſid. 4. In regard of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we hope for from our Calling.</note> the Neceſſity of ſuffering Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions from God's Appointment, and the Annexion of them to our Chriſtian Calling; and from our own Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do ſo, when we enter'd upon it; we may, yea, ought to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo doing we ſhall deſcry the conditional Neceſſity there is of this, if we would obtain the end of our Hope; the ſtrict and inſeparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion there is between ſuffering now,

            <p>For it is determined, that <hi>through much tribulation we muſt enter into the</hi>

            <p>And after the obſervance of this, he hath bound himſelf by his Word, by his Solemn Promiſe, by his Oath, to make us that Recompence mentioned; which in great Condeſcenſion to us, and for

            </p>
            <p>Indeed, was the Acqueſt of that Kingdom, that Sovereignty, that Crown, and the obtaining that Reſt free from all Diſquiet and Turmoil, (to which all Crowns here are abſolute Strangers, and ſo much the greater Strangers, as

For it is the Fate of all things which are eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, to be undervalued, let their intrinſick Worth be what it will, or as great as can be; while on the other hand, that which is vile in it ſelf, and of no Benefit but what fond and falſe Opinion ſuppoſeth, if it be far fetch'd, and dear bought, with Travel and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, is uſually priz'd at a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive rate.</p>

            <p>We are to carry our Conſideration<note place="margin">S. 7. § 4.

            <p>We are to believe he makes uſe of Adverſity and Troubles, and bodily Diſeaſes and Pains, as Chyrurgions do of their Inciſion Knives, their Saws, their Lances, their Cauſticks, not as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Cruelty of mangling, lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, wounding, ſearing, burning; but becauſe they find a neceſſity of taking thoſe Methods for the ſaving of their Patients Life: So that what ſeems Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to his Perſon, proceeds from a tender regard to the Preſervation of it: For while a corrupted or gangreened<note place="margin">Baſ.

            <p>The Reflection of <hi>Tertullian</hi> on the dangerouſneſs of his Condition, if God ſhould not uſe ſuch a Medicinal courſe with him as that of Afflictions is, made him ſay, He ſhould ſuſpect and be afraid of ſuch an Indulgence of the Lord, as not a real kindneſs, and which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to caution us againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating a who Man proſpers in his wicked ways; whom God vouchſafes not to check by ſome ſevere Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe inſtead of favouring ſuch an one, the Lord is incenſed to ſuch a degree againſt him, that he will not let him ſuffer; that is, he will not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him with the Scourge of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>

            <p>When we are aſſaulted with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, we ought to rely upon his Providence which is engaged, That no Temptation ſhall happen to us but what is ordinary, and ſo requires but an ordinary Force to oppoſe it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is common to Men ſhall befal us; and upon the Fidelity of his Word, which he hath paſſed, that he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above our ſtrength, above what we are able; and moreover, that he will with<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8</note> the Temptation make a way to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it; that his Grace, as he told St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he beſought him thrice, that he would<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> remove the Meſſenger of Satan which buffeted him, take out the Thorn in his Fleſh, will be ſufficient for us.</p>
            <p>When we have reaſon to believe that God is angry with us, by laying Trouble upon our Loyns, we are to hope, that he will neither ſuffer his whole Diſpleaſure, his whole Tempeſt to ariſe, nor all his Waves to go over our Heads; nor yet be angry with us for ever, ſuffer his Wrath to burn like Fire for evermore: That the All-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful will attemperate his Judgments with Mercy, the All-mindful will not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35429:100"/> forget to be gracious, nor ſhut up his loving-kindneſs in diſpleaſure; the Omnipotent will not abſent himſelf for ever by with-holding the Light of his Countenance, or withdrawing his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Influences.</p>
            <p>Under Sorrow and Dejection of Spirit we ought to rely waiting on him,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 20.</note> that his Indignation will ſoon be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; that if he hath forſaken us for a Moment, (it is no more, however our Computation may extend it into a farther length) he will return, and with great Mercies gather us.</p>

                  </gap>.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35429:103"/> him as a Free-will Offering; he accepts it kindly now, and will return it with large Thanks hereafter.</p>
            <p>When we are injured, and bear our ill Treatment patiently, out of Conſcience towards God requiring this Behaviour, we are his Confeſſors, though the ground of our Suffering be not Religion; and he is pleaſed to look upon it as an Engagement laid upon him, ſo as to acknowledge himſelf our Debtor.</p>
            <p>I ſay, with reſpect to this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to own himſelf our Debtor, while in truth we are his by reaſon of our ſins; as one obliged to cancel thoſe Bonds, by which as by Bonds Signed, and Sealed, and delivered, we rendred our ſelves obnoxious to the payment of the utmoſt Farthing, to ſuffer the extream Puniſhment due to them, and to diſcharge us from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> entirely to pardon them; and not only ſo, but to make us ſatisfaction, (I do not mean here the ſatisfaction of recompenſing us for the Injuries we have ſuſtained, but in reckoning ſeverely with the injurious.) He hath engaged to repay home in Vengeance unto thoſe from whom we

            <p>And I hope this is not an improper Conſideration to urge us to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Patience, or to facilitate the Exerciſe of a Virtue, with which Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is inſeparably joyn'd, ſince the Apoſtle hath alledged it for a Motive to quiet and allay our Spirits, while the ſenſe of the Wrongs and the ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage we ſuffer might ſtir them up, and incenſe us to retaliate upon the Authors of our Grievances.</p>

            <p>O how is this ſingle Conſideration, that if we leave our innocent oppreſſed Cauſe in his Hands, without proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vindicate our ſelves by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil for Evil, he will take it into Conſideration, and do us right upon our potent Enemies, able to extinguiſh all ſparks of Revenge, and to check and ſtifle all deſires after it, or even prevent the riſing of any ſuch Thoughts as may meditate upon making ſuch an Attempt!</p>
            <p>Will not this well ponder'd be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the warmeſt, or thoſe who are the quickeſt to reſent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or the prompteſt to return it, wait quietly, God's good time for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Work, <hi>i. e.</hi> The executing

            <p>Common Experience teacheth us,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Pat. c. 10. 165.</note> that Princes and Maſters of Families are not well-pleaſed, that their Subjects or Servants ſhould be their own Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries, do themſelves right upon their Fellow-Subjects or Servants, (ſo they falſly call their taking Revenge of them:) Nay, they oft puniſh their forward Inſolence in this, while they are ready on the other hand to give them ample Satisfaction for Abuſes or Wrongs done them, if with reſpect to their Commands and Pleaſure they put them up in ſilence and quietneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making or endeavouring a return, and are content to refer the Eſtimate and Reparation of them to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sentence. In like manner our Heavenly King and ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter takes it better and kinder at the

And depend we may upon the Security of his Word and Juſtice, that if we decline the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Vengeance our ſelves out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, whoſe peculiar and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable Prerogative Vengeance is, and devolve the Cognizance of them to his Judicature, That the righteous Judge will decree us a Satisfaction for our Dammages, far exceeding that we could take, adjudge us Reparations not only above them, but above what we can ask or think; <hi>i. e.</hi> above all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, ſince there is nothing that is pleaſing but we have the confidence to ask; and not any one thing ſimply poſſible, but we have Faculties to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or imagine it.</p>
            <p>Conſidering this, O my Soul, why ſhouldſt thou be caſt down? Or why ſhouldſt thou be ſo diſquieted within me, upon every imaginary Neglect, ſuppoſed Affront, miſconſtrued Word, or ill-interpreted Carriage of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Why ſhouldſt thou hereupon

            <p>But why ſhouldſt thou do this, if the Injury and Miſchief was real; if there was the oppreſſion of the Enemy in the caſe? Will not the meditation that this, unleſs repented of, will fall upon his own head; and that God will make thee the largeſt Retribution thou canſt imagine or wiſh for, if thou art not overcome of Evil, calm thy boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Paſſions of Anger and Revenge, and make thee bear even the greateſt Outrages, without ſtudying a requital thy ſelf, or deſiring any other than that which he will make thee?</p>

            <p>But may be this will be reckon'd but a ſmall Advantage, or ſcarce any at all, that the Righteous Judge ſhall vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our oppreſſed Innocency, and puniſh our injurious Adverſary; and yet this is of Conſolation to us in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes under filthy and reproachful Language, or contumelious Uſage, that we can take a courſe with the Authors of theſe, and that that Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will give us at leaſt this amends, that it will puniſh them; and may be an Inducement to make us put them up quietly; on the conſideration of ſuch a Satisfaction, if there was no other, (traduced as the meditation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge) only deferred to another World.</p>

            <p>The Martyrs and Confeſſors had this conſideration of the happineſs of another Life, the Joys of Heaven; they ſet God before their Eyes as their great Reward, look'd up with an Eye of Faith to Jeſus, who ſtood ready to Crown them with the Glory that he himſelf had; and this made them rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy than ſuffer thoſe Torments, which were preparatory to infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures and Honours; count their Priſons fair Pallaces, and eſteem their Chains as Bracelets and Ornaments, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> did. This made them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Croſs, the Gibbet, the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with as much Chearfulneſs as dear and cordial Friends do one another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long Abſence, looking upon them as ſo many ſeveral Aſcents towards Thrones, and thoſe in their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from whence they came, as Stairs by which they were to go up to the Gates of the Heavenly Palace, and have admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there; this made them haſten to their Execution with as much ſpeed as ever Conquerors in any Games to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Prize they had won; becauſe they look'd upon it as that which put them into an immediate Capacity of obtaining a Crown of Glory. Thus

In St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Phraſe, Gave them an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the kiſſing and embracing their Father, as he calls the beholding him. Thus, and for theſe Reaſons <hi>Lucius</hi> thanked <hi>

               <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and their Lieutenants of Provinces, obſerving how forward the Chriſtians were to ſeek for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with what Addreſs they courted it, and with what pleaſure they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it, held themſelves neceſſitated to forbid by Edicts the executing them.</p>

            <p>This made that Sex we uſually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage as tender and fearful, to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt ſharp and certain Death, with as much delight as ever the moſt gay and effeminate of them did to Masks, or Balls, or Plays.</p>
            <p>This made the ancient Champions of Chriſtianity to find as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure amidſt the Smoak and Flame of their Fiery Ordeals, as ever the moſt voluptuous in taking the perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Air amidſt Groves of Jaſmin and Myrtle, or that which was embalmed by Winds blowing off from the Spicy Coaſt.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they believed their Souls ſhould be carried up in thoſe Chariots of Fire, and enter Heaven in Triumph, as <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken up in one, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and all aſcended thither.

            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:35429:114"/>
            <p>From this Conſideration they were as much recreated amidſt Chaldrons of melted Lead, (I think I cannot call it <hi>ſcalding</hi> without a Soleciſm and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as ever Sun-burnt Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were by waſhing off the Sweat and Duſt from their Limbs in ſome clear Chryſtalline Brook; or even in Ice and Snow, as the Forty Martyrs of <hi>Sebaſte,</hi> as ever frozen Traveller did by ſuppling his Limbs in a warm Bath) becauſe they were forthwith to<note place="margin">V. <hi>S.

Hence the Rack and Wheel on which they were extended and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was made ſoft to them as the Down of Swans, becauſe they knew that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring on them, they ſhould enjoy a Reſt in thoſe quiet Regions above, whoſe perpetuity ſhould never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted nor perfection diſcompoſed: The painfulleſt Martyrdom was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone with as much pleaſure as ever voluptuous perſon drank of a Bowl temper'd the moſt agreeable to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, becauſe they eſteemed it the <hi>Cup of Salvation.</hi> This Reflexion made the Primitive Chriſtians offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Tormentors, and as fearful they ſhould not obtain the

            <p>So <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is recorded to have done, and by ſuch a Challenge as it were, provoked the Magiſtrate to put him to Death, that ſo by his Blood thus generouſly ſhed, he might waſh out the Infamy which the Cowardice of <hi>Sapritius</hi> in recanting the Faith, might otherwiſe have left upon the Chriſtian Name: Though this volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary offering of themſelves without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inquiſition, or previous to any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion was forbid. They wiſh'd for Wild Beaſts, as if to be devoured by them for the ſake of Chriſt was the Fruition of a Pleaſure. So <hi>Ignatius</hi> did, and ſo he called it; <hi>They drew them to them,</hi> as if they were not fierce enough to aſſail them, ſo <hi>Germanus</hi> did, when the Proconſul adviſed him to conſider he was in the Flower of his Age, and to have ſo kind a regard to his Life, as to ſave it.

            <p>But what do I ſpeak of the power of this Faith or Hope in Chriſtians to make them thus to endure, or thus to meet their Sufferings. The very <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe hope of a future Reſurrection was not ſo firm, becauſe their Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was not ſo clear, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not accept deliverance from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, expecting a better Reſurrection, but underwent ſome of the cruelleſt Fleaing, as if it had been no more than cutting off the Fore-skin.</p>

               <hi>he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> The Collection we ſhall make from ſuch Conſiderations will be, That if we are Sons, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of the <hi>incorruptible Inheritance which our Father hath laid up for us in Heaven;</hi> and if we are his beloved Sons, we ſhall taſte deep of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we cannot miſs of an ample <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that Inheritance. And by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſuch a Deduction we ſhall be enabled to bear our Diſeaſes, which proceed originally from God, and are not the Fruits of our own Diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery, with Patience at leaſt. If it doth not operate thus upon us, but we are reſtleſs and clamorous for being thus treated, we muſt be more mad than they would be, who ſhould complain of the trouble of carrying their Deeds they have to ſhew for proving their Title to a fair Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to be rid of this Inconvenience would throw them away.</p>
            <p>The nearer Proſpect that Diſeaſes, eſpecially thoſe of Age give us of this Inheritance, and the conſideration that they are taking us by the hand to put us into poſſeſſion of it. The nearer view they afford of our Journeys end,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35429:117"/> and the conſideration that they are bringing us to it as faſt as they can, and of our likelyhood to gain our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, while they are making wide and large Chinks in our Priſons, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking the Doors, or undermining the Walls of them, will very much conduce to this; or elſe we muſt be extreamly ſtupid and egregious Fools. For what Heir, if he was not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd, would be peeviſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for being within a very little of having his Eſtate in his hands? What Traveller that were not ſo, after being ſufficiently wearied and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his Spirits almoſt ſpent with the length of the Journey, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine for being nigh the end of it? Or what Priſoner not being ſo, would murmur that he had a fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of getting his Diſcharge, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his eſcape?</p>
            <p>Afflicted with Infirmities and Pains, this conſideration is enough to make us bear them patiently, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of ſuch a Demeanour will be, Our Bodies ſhall renew their ſtrength like Eagles, and we in them like Eagles ſhall mount up to meet the Lord's coming in the Clouds; and that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35429:118"/> as they ſhall renew their Vigour, ſo they ſhall have a perpetual Exemption from all Labour and Fatigue, be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of rendring God a Homage day and night, and be no more weary of that conſtant Service than Spirits are, and perform it with as much Agility and Expedition as winged <hi>Seraphims</hi> fly upon the execution of his Commands; that they ſhall be no more troubled with groſs feculent Humours, which by their exceſs and quantity are the matter and procreative cauſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and Aches, but ſhall be refined to a degree of Purity and Spirituality like that of Ethereal Subſtances. Are we afflicted with Hunger and Thirſt, which when they are extream, are of all our ſenſual Appetites the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and irreſiſtible, the conſideration that we are approaching towards that condition and ſtate of Life wherein we ſhall not hunger or thirſt any more after that which periſheth; and our hunger and thirſt ſhall be after eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good; that the one ſhall be ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe Delicacies with which the Table, at which all the Saints of God who have gone before us, we ſhall ſit down in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35429:118"/> is furniſhed; the other quench'd in thoſe Rivers of Pleaſure which are ever flowing at the Right Hand of God, the moſt pleaſant that Infinite Goodneſs, which is always ſtreaming out in Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of it ſelf, can make them for the Taſte; this thought, if it will give us no eaſe, will keep our Appetites from being enraged and inflamed higher by Impatience.</p>
            <p>If under the loſs of our ſight we are not to be comforted with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical<note place="margin">Hierom.

            <p>For ſetting the future Rewards before our Eyes, we ſhould look upon Death then as no other than the Goal, at which, the Race being done, we are to receive the Meeds we ran for; as the Port where landed we are upon the Shoar of eternal Happineſs; as a generous Patron freeing us out of a ſtate of Slavery, and the Priſon where we are detained, and raiſing us to a glorious condition of Liberty; as a kind Friend, by whoſe means we are conducted to thoſe Manſions of Bliſs which have been long ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us in our Fathers Houſe, as removing out of a Cottage of Loom and Clay, expoſed to the Injuries of all ſorts of Weathers into a Building not made with Hands, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſay, not as theſe earthly Tabernacles; into a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:35429:120"/> whoſe Foundations, Walls and Gates are all of precious Stones in the higheſt Heavens, as a retiring from the Hardſhips and Dangers of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Warfare, wherin we are engaged in continual Conteſts with Fleſh and Blood within, and Principalities and Powers and Spiritual Wickedneſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, by whom we are ſo oft and ſo ſhamefully foil'd, to a place of perfect Peace and Security, free from the leaſt annoyance of ſuch Incurſions, or ſuch Aſſailants, or any fears of them; where, having obtained our great Captains Diſmiſſion and Licence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, we ſhall expect till he make his return to Earth; after which, his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs being done there, and we having Bodies prepared for us to put on, we ſhall attend on him when he makes his ſecond glorious Aſcent into Heaven, and be a part of that days Pomp and Celebrity; as the putting off Rags of Corruption in order to be arrayed in Robes of State; as that which mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth an advantageous Exchange for us; and by means of which for Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Calamity we gain Happineſs; for Tears and Grief, Joys; for painful Labour and Toil, Reſt; for carking

            <p>If they, who, when they ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Threſhold of this World, ready to leave it, had no View, or but an obſcure and uncertain one of another confining upon this, could ſupport themſelves with Patience under its proluſory Agonies and Skirmiſhes, and fortifie themſelves with Courage againſt its down-right Attack and Blow, by the help of ſuch Meditations as theſe, (That dying was but going out of a weather-beaten Houſe; a travelling to another place, as <hi>Plato;</hi> a Diſmiſſion from their attendance here, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Antoninus;</hi> (the ſame Phraſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by which the Aged <hi>Simeon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, when he calls it a <hi>Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>) but a going the way which all muſt tread, as <hi>Horace;</hi> but a putting off the tatter'd Garments of Fleſh and

            <p>This too, as it will ſuſtain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">2.

            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:35429:121"/>
            <p>As therefore it matters not upon the Square, whether we die in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Youth, Manhood, or Old Age, ſooner or later, any more than it doth in what Seaſon of the year, whether in Spring, Summer, Autumn or Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; (and if there be any odds, they ſeem to have the advantage, who die, having ſeen leaſt of the Worlds Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or felt leaſt of the Calamities of Humane Life) whether we die at home or abroad, ſince every place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sky is a wiſe and brave Man's Country, (he being a Citizen and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon of the World) or none on this ſide Heaven is, and every part of the Earth is equally diſtant from that; whether in the poſſeſſion of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in our own Country, or in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in another, ſince this may ſend us into places more benign and hoſpitable than our own Soil was, where we may be more eſteemed for our Vertue, ſee more Order, Gravity and Conduct, and greater Examples of Prudence, Fidelity and Conſtancy than among our own People; whether we die at Sea or Land, whether we feed Fiſh or Worms, whether we die a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or a violent Death, whether our
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:35429:122"/> Priſon Doors fly open of themſelves, or they are broken open by Force; whether we die on our Beds by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or by Fire at a Stake; by a Squin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy there, or by a Halter on a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; by a lingring Conſumption there, or by the ſudden ſtroak of a Sword or Ax on the Scaffold; by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Stone or Gout, or the Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Paſſion there, or by being broken on the Wheel; whether we die that which is called a glorious Death, by the hands of our Enemy in the Field, or that which is reckon'd an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious one, by the hand of a Publick Executioner, provided the Cauſe be not Criminal; for its this alone can make any Death ſcandalous, as it is only the goodneſs of a Cauſe can make any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: Virtue can ennoble every Death, give Glory to the Scandal of the Croſs; and Piety can make the Perſon who is hanged, drawn and quartered, an illuſtrious fulgent Martyr: And neither the Tree, nor Block, nor any kind of Death can diſgrace Honeſty, or ſhame Religion. Nor laſt of all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after Death, our Bodies receive a decent Interment, or they are expoſed to the Beaſts of the Field, or their

            <p>I ſay therefore, as it matters not upon the ſquare what kind of Death, or where or how we die, if ſo be we are prepared to die well; ſo if there was any real difference cauſed by the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:35429:123"/> kind, manner, time or place, which might aggravate one kind of Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, or make it more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or intolerable at one time or place than another, yet the juſt conſideration that the iſſue of every Death was to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Man in all times and places the ſame, and would certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in his Eternal Felicity, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay all the affrightfulneſs our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are apt to raiſe in us, remove all the Difficulties, correct all the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and mitigate all the ſharpneſs and pains they are ready to figure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in any of the ſorts of Death.</p>
            <p>Now for the keeping up this aſſured Expectation of a Reward, on which depends the meeting of a violent Death, or the bearing a natural one, or the Diſeaſes preparatory to it, with conſtancy, that our Hope may enter within the Veil where this Happineſs is kept; a thing very difficult to do, while our Souls have ſo much affinity with mortal Bodies, and Commerce with Sence. We are to conſider who it is that hath promiſed to beſtow it; he is God; and if the Word of a good Prince is as great ſecurity as a Subject can ask or deſire, ſurely nothing can
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:35429:123"/> be wiſh'd for or imagin'd greater than his who is immutable. And that while the fulfilling of other Promiſes depends upon this tacit Condition, if he ſees it convenient for us; the performance of this reſts only upon the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration of what Death<note place="margin">S. 7. § 3. <hi>m.</hi> 3. The death of our friends with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and evenneſs.</note> is, and what it leads to, as it will thus ſupport us with Patience to bear its Sentence, or arm us with Courage to meet it when it marches directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves; ſo it will uphold our Spirits, that they ſink not under the weight of Grief; ſmooth them, that they be not exaſperated, when its Stings pierce our neareſt and deareſt Friends; a Paſſion, which is many times too ſtrong for thoſe who have maſtered all others; (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged of the Lady <hi>Paula</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature, even good Nature is on her ſide; rather than lament their Loſs, if we were not corrupted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to bewail our own, in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of their Society, which was that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> confeſſeth, ſway'd them to mourn for <hi>Nepotian,</hi> we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the important Advantages they have gained by it, at their being

            <p>We ſhould then regard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their dead Bodies to the ground, while at the ſame time we know that they ſhall there rot and crumble into Duſt, be the Food of Worms and creeping things, (a Thought indeed, which of it ſelf, without proceeding further or looking higher, inclines us to make lamentation for thoſe who, warm'd with a ſpark of Life, were the <hi>Light of our Eyes,</hi> and the <hi>Joy of our Hearts</hi>) but as a leading them offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into their Chambers, or their ceremonious entring into them, and<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 20.</note> ſhutting the Doors upon themſelves; as a reſting themſelves, and ſleeping on thoſe Beds there for ſome ſhort time; from which being rouſed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels<note place="margin">Iſa 57. 2.</note> powerful Voice, crying, <hi>Awake ye that ſleep in the duſt, and riſe;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Blaſt of God's Trump, and the mighty Shout with which the Lord, attended by a numerous retinue<note place="margin">1 Theſſ 4. 26.</note>

            <p>Did we riſe higher in our Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, or come nearer to our ſelves, and conſider that we our ſelves, if we ſhall be found alive at that day when that Honour ſhall be done them, ſhall have our Bodies, as we wear them, changed upon us into that glorious condition; or if we have put them off, and they are laid in the Grave, we ſhall have them raiſed and exalted to the ſame ſtate; and that in Body and Spirit conjunctly we ſhall enjoy the mutual Society of each other in perfect and interminable Felicity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the poſſibility or fear of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated again, inſtead of having our Spirits miſerably dejected, as uſually they are, when we are divided from

            </p>
            <p>The Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did before him propound the Conſideration of this Doctrine, (though then but darkly delivered or faintly entertained) for the ſame purpoſe, for the inſpiriting with Joy ſuch Mourners in <hi>Judah,</hi> who were diſconſolate upon the Mortality
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:35429:127"/> of their Friends, that their Dead ſhould live again. His Words are, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe; awake and ſing</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 19.</note> 
               <hi>ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt forth the dead.</hi> And the ſence of them ſeems to be this: Chear and raiſe up your Hearts, ye whom Affliction hath brought low, whoſe Bellies by reaſon thereof cleave to the duſt of the Ground, who lie overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with and buried under loads of Sorrow for the Slain of your People, whoſe Bodies lie ſcattered upon the ground; or for your deceaſed Friends, of whom Death hath by other ways poſſibly than the Sword bereft you; for they o'er whom ye mourn ſhall at the laſt day, together with my dead Body, be raiſed out of the Duſt or ſtate of Corruption, enlivened by the quickning Breath that ſhall return into them at the Word of the Almighty; even as tender Herbs killed by the ſharpneſs of Winter Froſts and Colds, ſhall by thoſe vital Dews and Heat the kind Spring liberally affords, recover, rear up their fallen Heads, and put on their gaudy Livery again.</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:35429:128"/>
            <p>Let us therefore comport with the Apoſtles Exhortation; inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming our ſelves with Grief, which corrodes and eats as much as Envy and Cares do, for our departed Friends; thoſe I mean, whoſe Piety and Virtue have made the Conjunction nearer, and the Cement cloſer than meer Fleſh and Blood could, and whom we have ground to hope departed hence in the Lord, let us comfort our ſelves that they have made ſo happy an Exit; yea, rather rejoyce, conſidering their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence, not as a forſaking, but a preceding us who ſurvive; not as a going quite away from us, but as an orderly paſſing on before into another World; as a turning out of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry road of Time, wearied with the Journey that way, into that of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Perſons indeed on whom Death executes the Office of a Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, arreſts them to deliver them up to Divine Vengeance; thoſe for whom <hi>Tophet</hi> of old was ordained, for whom everlaſting Fire was prepared, ought in juſt pity to be lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their departure hence is into that Lake of Brimſtone which burneth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:35429:128"/> which burneth with this Fire; the mouth of Hell receives and devours their Souls, as the Pit doth their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and a ſecond Death gnaws on them as Worms and creeping things do on their putrified Carcaſes. Tears of Compaſſion may be ſhed for ſuch Unbelievers and wicked impenitent Doers, becauſe they paſs hence into the moſt ſad deplorable Eſtate, out of which neither our Prayers nor their own Cries can relieve them, any more than the Tears of either can allay their Flames.</p>
            <p>But we are to exult at the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Righteous, (ſuch bleſſed ones of their Father, as had an Inheritance deſigned for them in his Kingdom <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world,</hi> of whom he gave his Angels charge here, commanded them to ſerve and attend on them as miniſtring Spirits to their Salvation, about whom he gave his Heavenly Hoſt Orders to pitch their Camp to guard them from Evil) as quitting only their incommodious Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of Fleſh, leaving only the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and Diſquietudes, and Filthineſs of this World to paſs into Manſions of Reſt, and Bliſs, and Glory provided

            <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> thought they had<note place="margin">Valer. Max. l. 2. c. 6.

And others, who thought they had reaſon to lament the Dead, becauſe they had loſt the Light, yet judged there was a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to be obſerved in Grief, and a meaſure ſet to Tears, the Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſick Mind, as well as to other Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And if after Death we make <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> for them, it ought to be upon a Reflection, that they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo long abſent from the Lord, while they ſojourned in <hi>Meſech,</hi> (either a Country or time of prolongation) and were confined to the <hi>Tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> (this Land of Darkneſs and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or theſe gloomy Tabernacles of Earth) as the ſame <hi>Thracians</hi> howl'd at
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35429:129"/> the Birth of their own or Friends Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, looking upon it as an entrance upon a woful Tragical Scene.</p>
            <p>When <hi>he maketh the Storm a Calm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107 28, 29.</note> tranſlates our Friends from this Life into another, <hi>ſo that the waves thereof are still,</hi> they are no longer toſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtable Billows, nor driven by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Winds; <hi>then as they are glad becauſe they are at quiet, and he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to their deſired Haven:</hi> So ought we to praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs to them, that they have got off the tempeſtuous and dangerous Sea, and reach'd their quiet Port. Thus<note place="margin">S. Hierom.

            <p>If we behave our ſelves otherwiſe, grieve and make bitter Moan for their Death, we do them wrong; <hi>i. e.</hi> (as much as we can do them any, whoſe Felicity is incapable of being leſſened) by our ill Suſpicions, Jealouſies and Fears, (or ſeeming ill ones) of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whether it be happy or not; or elſe our ſelves by diſtruſting or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to diſtruſt the Immortality of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:35429:130"/> the Soul, and Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as if ſuppoſing that the one at the moment of Death evaporates into Air, and the other after ſome time ſhall be irrevocably loſt in the Duſt: Upon which account St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth<note place="margin">Ep. 3. ad Heliodor.</note>

And we ſtain the Glory of our Faith, while with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that we do not, what Men of Infidelity could, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſupport the Death of their Friends without any piteous mourning or Complaints.</p>
            <p>And yet it may not be indecent for them to weep for them whom they may think, or at leaſt cannot tell but they have utterly loſt; but its diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for a Chriſtian to do ſo, while he knows they live, or but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to believe that their Death is a tranſlation to Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>Mourning and Blacks are improper on this occaſion, and very diſagreeable
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:35429:130"/> to their ſtate of Felicity, whom we believe to be arrayed in <hi>White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Palms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then, ſuch is the Advantage accrewing by Patience, that it ſhall be rewarded with immortal Happineſs, and Diſeaſes lead to the Door, Death opens it, or is the very Door it ſelf through which we muſt paſs to take Poſſeſſion of it, conſidering this, What can we do more reaſonably, than upon a Bed of Sickneſs to uphold our weak Spirits, and ſuſtain our feeble afflicted Limbs with Patience? Then to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with it, when we ſee our laſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Death, approaching towards us to ſeize our Perſons; and the more, if it be violent, with how much more terrible appearances Malice and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity have dreſſed it, or with how much more Horror it is arrayed by them on purpoſe to diſorder us, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded always our Cauſe be good, and we are condemned to ſuffer it for Righteouſneſs ſake?</p>
            <p>Or what can we do more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, than to ſupport our Minds with this, that they do not droop or flag when Death hath removed from us any of our beloved Friends; if ſuch,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35429:131"/> whom we may upon ſufficient grounds believe to have died in the Lord, in peace with him, while they died not for him, or laid not down their Lives for a Teſtimony to him, or ſigned his Doctrine with their Blood; eſteeming their Death to have done them the favour of inſtating them in the Regions of Bliſs; and thereupon looking on the other way of behaving our ſelves, of immoderate Mourning for them, as that which betrays either Infidelity in general of the Souls ſubſiſting after this Life, or too much ſuſpicion and fear in particular of their happy Eſtate; or if none of theſe, yet too much partial Love to our ſelves, becauſe they are ſeparated from us for a time; or ſomething of Envy, while we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their being made happy before us, and our ſelves being left ſtill to combat for that Prize they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

               <hi>Fabiola,</hi> having diſpoſed of all her Worldly Goods before, which was like heavy Baggage ſerving only to encumber, made her ſelf the lighter to fly to Heaven; or as the Apoſtles, who, though in act they forſook only their Smacks, and Fiſherboats, and Nets, yet in purpoſe left the whole World,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:35429:135"/> reſolving never to be burdened with any part of it, that they might keep better pace with their Leader.</p>
            <p>Being, I ſay, thus reminded by the Holy Spirit, of abſtracting our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the Earth, and things which periſh both with and without uſing, gathering Ruſt if hoarded, which in time will eat them; and breeding, if laid up, Moths which will conſume them; of communicating and diſtributing of our Goods, which is yet leſs than retaining no Propriety in what we have; than ſelling our Lands and Houſes, and laying the Price down at the Apoſtles or their Succeſſors Feet, to be diſpoſed of by them; it ſhall then come to paſs, that the Caſualties of Loſſes, or Diminutions in our Eſtate ſhall not diſturb us, which upon many accounts we ſtand bound to part with. Then being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded by this Spirit, if we have two<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 40.</note> Cloaks, of giving one to him who lacketh; of parting with our Cloak to him who by Violence and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would take away our Coat, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than contend in endleſs Suits of Law, or before Foreign Judges, for recovering of it, or Damages, it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:35429:135"/> ſhall come to paſs that the Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Robberies which the Lawleſs and Maſterleſs may commit on our Goods, ſhall not have the force to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us.</p>
            <p>Then being reminded by him of our<note place="margin">Luke 9. 23, 24.</note> Maſters Admonition, to <hi>take up his Croſs and follow after him;</hi> for which we have his Encouragement, That if we loſe our Lives for his ſake, we ſhall ſave them; to <hi>rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi>

            <p>Then being re-minded or inſtructed by him, that thoſe Diſeaſes by which we are not given over to Death, are ſent for our Chaſtiſement and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and thoſe by which we are, which tend to our Diſſolution, ſhall bring us to be with Chriſt; we ſhall not fret or vex our ſelves under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, whoſe end is to make us better, or Methods to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>

            <p>Beg of him we ſhould farther, to ſend this Spirit to be our immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, by ſhining in upon our Souls with ſuch direct Rays of chearful light, as through all the gloomy ſadneſs of our outward condition we may diſcern our belonging to the Election of Grace, and our affliction to be a mark that we are of that little Flock; read the Deeds of our Adoption that made us the Sons of God, and the Charter which gives us as Sons, a Title to an Inheritance reſerved for us in the Heavens; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing into our Hearts ſuch Peace, ſuch Joy and Exultation, which are the Fruits that bleſſed Spirit produceth, where he dwells, upon an inſurance from his concurrent Teſtimony with ours, that our ſins are pardoned, our perſons accepted and juſtified, and that God for having forſaken us for a ſmall moment, will <hi>gather us in great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>

               <hi>for having hid his face from us for ſo ſhort a while, will with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs look upon us;</hi> that neither Life nor Death, [neither the Calamities of the one, nor Terrors of the other,] <hi>nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,</hi> (not the Wiles nor rage of Devils) not <hi>things preſent, nor things to come;</hi> (not

            <p>To this Frame and Temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if the Holy Spirit the Comforter ſhall by any of the forementioned Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, or his own Operation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux upon us, vouchſafe to raiſe us, tranſported we ſhall be with the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delights of Heaven before we ſhall be caught up thither, be inebriated with its Pleaſures, before we ſit down with the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and the reſt of the honourable Gueſts of that place, to taſte them there; have the Kingdom of Heaven within us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are advanced to one of thoſe Manſions in that above us; and we ſhall be prepared to ſay in all truth as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> did, <hi>We had rather be in</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And Confident we may be, if we do, beſeech him to give us this Spirit, the Comforter, with that Faith, Ardor and Importunity as we ought, that he who promiſed to give him to thoſe who asked, (asked Believing) fervently and inceſſantly, will in purſuance of his immutable Promiſe beſtow him upon us, if not in ſuch high degrees and meaſures as I have mentioned, yet in ſuch a one at leaſt as may ſupport us with ſuch a ſufficient ſtock of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as may carry us through our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Walk, this Vale of Tears, till we come to the Mount of God; as may enable us to bear our Croſs with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, till it be taken off our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and erected into a Trophy of Glory.</p>
            <p>In this Confidence therefore, that not one Title of his Promiſes ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, (while all things elſe beſides his Truth as immovable and unchangeable as they appear to be, ſhall do ſo) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Completion; let us, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are afflicted, apply our ſelves to him for the execution of it, while we are in trouble, pour out our Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35429:138"/> him in ſome ſuch Prayer as this:</p>
            <div type="prayer">
               <head>A Prayer for <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>O God, juſt and righteous in all thy dealings with the Sons and Daughters of Men; but withal, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly compaſſionate to them, look down in much pity upon me thy poor afflicted Servant.</p>
               <p>Be not angry with me for ever, nor ſuffer thy wrath to burn continually like Fire.</p>
               <p>Forget not to be gracious, and ſhut not up thy loving-kindneſs in diſpleaſure: But in Judgment remember Mercy, and ſhew it by removing or mitigating my Sufferings; or if it ſhall be thy good pleaſure to afflict me yet farther by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing them, ſupport me by thy mighty Arm to bear them with Patience and Courage.</p>
               <p>To this end give me a Heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that miſery is the common incident of humane Life; that Calamities of one kind or other attend upon every ſtate and condition of it, eſpecially on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that they who are called by that honourable Name, abſtracting from their hopes of happineſs in another life,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:35429:138"/> are in this of all men most miſerable; that they who will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, beſides the ordinary Evils they are liable to as Men, muſt over and above ſuffer Perſecution as Chriſtians: And yet to ponder withal, that none of thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without thy knowledge and deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that my Afflictions do not come out of the Duſt, nor trouble ſpring out of the ground, but are the Demerits of my Sins, and the just Puniſhment inflicted by thee for them.</p>
               <p>And then aſſist me in arguing with my ſelf, how unreaſonable it is for me a Malefactor to complain of being puniſhed according to the deſerts of my Offences, that I ought rather in all equity to bear thy Indignation, O Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt thee. Convince me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that how harſh ſoever thy dealing with me is apt to ſeem to Fleſh and Blood, to which all Correction is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, yet of very faithfulneſs thou haſt cauſed me to be troubled; and then open my Lips to make this humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, That righteous art thou, O Lord, and juſt are thy Judgments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me in particular.</p>
               <p>Enable me to proceed yet farther; and in an entire ſubmiſſion of my ſelf to thee,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35429:139"/> and an abſolute reſignation of all my Concerns to thy Will and Pleaſure, ſay, <hi>Good is the hand of the Lord, let him do with me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe make me ſee and know that thy Chaſtiſements, while they are always the effects of thy Juſtice, are not always the marks of thy heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but oft-times on the contrary, the badges of thy favour, the cognizance of thy Children, and the proofs of thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love to them.</p>
               <p>And upon this ground make me not meerly to ſubmit my ſelf to thy abſolute diſpoſal as my Heavenly Father, but to adore thee likewiſe, and return thee all poſſible thanks for vouchſafing to uſe thy Rod for my Correction and Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>O may I, amidſt thy Juſtice in cauſing me to drink of a bitter Cup for my portion, look upon thy loving kindneſs in tempering this at the ſame time with Sweetneſs, and thy Goodneſs in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string it too; foraſmuch as thy infinite Wiſdom knows the draught will conduce to my Health; may I therefore take it from thy hand with all Reverence and Benediction of thy holy Name.</p>
               <p>O may I conſider the end for which thou afflicteſt me, which is to try and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35429:139"/> prove me, to purge away all my Droſs, and refine me, to bring me nearer to thy ſelf; that thou haſt appointed the way which leads to the Kingdom of Heaven to be by Suffering, and haſt ordained me to paſs through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tribulations before I can enter into it; and withal, the vaſt inequality, the unaccountable diſproportion between the lightneſs and momentarineſs of theſe preſent Sufferings, and the ſolidity and perpetuity of that Glory they ſhall work out; ſuch as will not admit any imaginable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
               <p>And then give me ſuch a frame of Spirit, as I may not only bear my lot with Patience, but exult in it; count it all Joy, that I fall into ſuch Trials and Afflictions.</p>
               <p>O my God, ſatisfie my Soul fully of the intimate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Connexion there is between ſuffering and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that endleſs Beatitude which thou haſt promiſed for a reward of my Obedience and Service.</p>
               <p>And then aid me being ſo perſwaded by thy Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to pray with the deepeſt ſincerity, with the moſt intenſe earneſtneſs my Soul is capable of, that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to cut and wound, to burn and ſear me here, ſo that I may by this means be preſerved ſound unto the day of the Lord, and may at that terrible time eſcape the being cut aſunder with the Sword of thy Vengeance, having my portion among Hypocrites, or being tormented in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Flames, with thoſe who are curſed from thy Preſence.</p>
               <p>For my encouragement to endure all this here, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to rejoyce that I am counted worthy to ſuffer; to run with chearfulneſs as well as Patience the Race that is ſet before me, however incumbred it may be with ſharp thorns, however beſet it may be with occaſions of troubles and affliction; grant me thy Grace to have my Heart always fixt in meditating on the great Example of the Captain of my Salvation, that I may continually have my
